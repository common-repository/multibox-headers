DISCONTINUED: This plugin adds Multibox headers to your post/page headers

== Description ==
**DISCONTINUED** Please note this plugin is no longer maintained, and you should *only* use if you have examined its code. Newer versions of WordPress use much better ways of including JavaScript.

Multibox Headers adds the necessary includes (JavaScript and CSS) to your WordPress pages/posts to use <a href="http://www.phatfusion.net/multibox/" title="Link to Multibox project page">Multibox</a>, from <a href="http://www.phatfusion.net/" title="Linkt to Phatfusion website">Phatfusion</a>

Unlike other plugins, this plugin does *NOT* alter your content, or tweak your galleries, it merely includes the Multibox client components in the header, and leaves it up to the author, or other plugins, to make use of Multibox. One such example plugin might be <a href="http://www.rutschmann.biz/php-mysql-javascript-und-ajax/multibox-wordpress-plugin">Wordpress Multibox PlugIn</a> from Manfred Rutschmann.

= Changelog =
* Version 1.00 - Initial release.


== Installation ==

There are 2 ways of installation. If your setup supports it, you can search for the plugin, by name, within your WordPress control panel and install it from there.
Alternatively, you download the .zip file, unzip it, and copy the resultant `multibox-headers` folder to the `wp-content/plugins/` folder of your WordPress instaltion folder.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't my galleries use Multibox when I click on the images? =
This plugin *only* adds the required headers (both JavaScript and CSS) for Multibox, it does not enable content to use Multibox directly. You'll have to use an other plugin for that, or manually edit your content as per the Multibox instructions.

= What is Multibox =
It's a lightbox-style JavaScript library but with better support for media, including Flash movies. Read more at the <a href="http://www.phatfusion.net/multibox/" title="Link to Multibox project page">Multibox website</a>.
